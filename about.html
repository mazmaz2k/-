          <p>Living a healthier life can not only extend your life, it can also improve the quality. Feeling
          physically better and having control over your own life can greatly increase your mental health as well. Although
          there are some aspects of physical and mental health that are beyond an individual's (and science's) control, there
          are many things that people can do to improve their quality of life.
